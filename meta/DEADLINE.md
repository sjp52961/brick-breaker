## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

I chose to create an arcade game, specifically Brick Breaker. The app
starts with a ball, paddle, and wall of bricks. The ball bounces around and if
it hits a brick, the brick will be removed from the wall. The ball bounces off
of the walls and paddle; however, it cannot touch the ground or else the player
will lose a life. To avoid the ball from touching the ground, the player can move
the paddle left and right using the arrow keys. Each player starts with three lives.
If the player loses three lives, the game is over. If the player breaks all of the
bricks without losing any lives, they win the game.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned how creative you can be with JavaFX. When building this app,
it was fun getting creative with the different nodes and their colors,
functions, etc. If you have a vision for JavaFX, your ability to create it
is pretty limitless, or so it felt like this when creating this project.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I wish I started sooner so I could make my app more complex. This project is time
consuming because it requires a lot of thought, and if I started sooner I would be able
to come up with more creative features for this app.
